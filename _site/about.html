        <h3>Background:</h3><br>
        <p>I'm a 17 year old that has come from Nepal. I've lived in Scotland for a bit over 6 years now.
          I have lived in other countrys such as Spain and Ireland before settling in Scotland,
           and I am currently studying Applied Computing(BSc) at the University of Dundee. </p>
        <h3>Interests:</h3><br>
        <p>
          Outside of school a sport that I find interesting is badminton, as I joined the school club and later an outside club. Badminton allowed me to become better at communicating and learning from my peers and teachers, as I watched them play as a method of improving and taught me to stay calm in stressful situations. I also rather enjoy reading in my free time as I find it to be a nice way to relax and I am particularly fond of the fantasy genre . I think this has expanded my vocabulary and allowed me to be more creative. Another hobby I have is playing video games. This is an interest that I've had for a long time and continue to enjoy. I believe it has made me more confident in stressful situations and helped me communicate better with others.
