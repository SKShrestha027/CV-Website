          <h3>Work Experience:</h3><br>
          <p>During my time on high school I participated in an event called Sci-fun. My role during this event was to lead students around and show them the exhibits and answer any questions they had. This is relevant as I think the ability to guide and communicate well with the customer would be useful in helping the customer find items they are interested in or checking-out items they have.
            When I lived in Nepal, I volunteered in helping during festivals. Over the course of the festivities, I had to transport goods and help sell them to consumers. I also had to prepare rooms for the events and help cook meals. I think this would be relevant as it has given me some informal experience working and talking to consumers.

        <h3>Skills:</h3><br>
        <p>
          When I was younger I did quite a lot of travelling as my parent’s place of work changed. This allowed me to see multiple cultures and become able to speak Spanish and Nepalese. I think this could be useful as it would allow me to communicate better with different consumers.
          Due to learning coding in school and university I have become proficient with the office package, including excel and its queries. This has also taught me to not be disheartened by failure and to be creative when problem solving.
          Studying at university has taught me the importance of time management and being able to communicate effectively in group work. I think that these skills can be transferred into the workplace environment, as being able to relay information to peers and being on time will be crucial to working effectively.
